# 🖼️ Image Encryption using Pixel Manipulation

This is a simple Python tool to encrypt and decrypt images by manipulating pixel values.  
Completed as part of **Task-02** for the **Cyber Security Internship Program** at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 🔐 How It Works

- Each pixel's RGB values are modified by adding a key during encryption.
- Decryption reverses this by subtracting the same key.
- Uses the Python Pillow (PIL) library.

## ✅ Features

- Encrypt and decrypt any image.
- Simple pixel-based logic.
- Customizable encryption key.

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3
- Pillow  
Install using:
```bash
pip install Pillow
